#### 1.00: Cloud data retrieval and storage are efficient with minimal delays.
Our application demonstrates efficient cloud data retrieval and storage with minimal delays. When data is stored in Firestore, it is readily available for retrieval and can be accessed within milliseconds.
We have verified the efficiency of our data retrieval process by printing retrieved data on the console, confirming that data retrieval occurs promptly without causing any significant performance issues or delays in our application.

Here are the screenshots of data retrieval:
