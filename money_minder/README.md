## Changes from the Proposal
### Additions
Internationalization: Content and writings in Money Minder is translated to Spanish.
### Modification
Financial Goal Tracking and Budgetting: These two features are merged as they serve similar purposes. This will prevent the user from being confused on which list to navigate into.

### Removal:
All attempts of chanllenging features have been discarded to ensure our app only has complete, usable features.
Extra challenges: Reciept scanning, location tracking, multiple user support

       - Also add the images in pubspec.yaml file
    
    - lib
         - data - files for the SQLite database
         - model - files for SQLite database
         - views - all dart files
